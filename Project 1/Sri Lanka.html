            <p>There are some really great places to go scuba diving around Trincomalee. Just jump on a dive boat and you'll be off to one of the 
                best places to scuba dive in Sri Lanka! There are also a ton of scuba companies in town so prices are competitive and generally 
                cheaper than Sri Lanka's southern coast. Scuba diving around Trincomalee is best from April to September when the monsoon season is over. 
                The most popular dives are all shallower than 18m making it perfect for beginners. </p>

            <p>Sigiriya is one of the most valuable historical monuments of Sri Lanka. Referred by locals as the Eighth Wonder of the World, 
                this ancient palace and fortress complex has significant archaeological importance and attracts thousands of tourists annually. 
                It is probably the most visited tourist destination in Sri Lanka. The fortress complex includes remnants of a ruined palace, 
                surrounded by an extensive network of fortifications, vast gardens, ponds, canals, alleys, and fountains. </p>
