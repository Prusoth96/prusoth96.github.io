            Hiking in Sri Lanka is something which most travellers will have dreamed of at some point. Even just 
            the name of the country conjures up images of lush, green rainforest, rolling mountains, tropical wildlife 
            and turquoise water. The best hiking in Sri Lanka showcases that. The country was named the best country 
            in the world for travellers to visit back in 2019 by Lonely Planet. They cited its rich and accessible 
            wildlife as well as the surf scene, culture and the friendliness of the people.

            A lot of hiking in Sri Lanka is on well known paths and routes. Not in the Knuckles mountain range. 
            hat even Sri Lankans do not really know the trail that we are hiking on, and joked about how when he 
            showed other guides the photos upon his return from the route, they all wanted to go visit. The trek 
            heads deep into the rainforest and the rugged wild of the Knuckles Range. The range was named due to their 
            resemblance to a clenched fist. Picture yourself immersed in majestic mountains reaching up to 2000m. The 
            landscape is dotted with huge cascading waterfalls. You pass through tiny villages and spend the night wild 
            camping in a real wilderness. You will likely see buffalos and if you are lucky, you could even spot boars, 
            toque macaque monkeys and purple-faced monkeys. If you are extremely lucky, you could see elephants and 
            leopards in the jungle too. Though the chances you will bump into them trekking along the trails with their 
            backpacks aren not so high.
